# Chat-Room
This program is a Java application that allows the user to setup a chat room server and have multiple clients connect to the chat room server. The chat room is encrypted using AES, and keys are sent to each other using ECDS.

# Usage
The code for the server is under the /Chat Server/ directory, and the code for the client is under the /Chat Client/ directory. Since these two programs were made using two different Eclipse projects, you should easily be able to import this into your Eclipse workspace.
